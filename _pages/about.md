Eric is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Yingkai Zhang lab in the Dept. of Chemistry at NYU. His work developed a workflow to rigorously and quantitatively show the limitations of and then improve molecular generative models to predict of allosteric ligand poses on kinases. he's collaborated across cross-functional teams with chemical biologists and software engineers. Previously, he's worked as an undergraduate researcher forcued on with Yu-Shan Lin on enhanced sampling metadynamics simulations of cyclic peptides in Dept. of Chemistry at Tufts University.

Outside of research, he is passionate about STEM outreach, helping initiate and organize NYU Chemistry department's first outreach event with a local NYC high school. Currently, he is supporting the work done by the [Gotham Data Clinic](https://gothamdataclinic.org/) to expand access to data science education. 

Currently, he is in batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/about) working on data science/ML workflows for protein engineering projects and improving his technical volitional skills.
